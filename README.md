## Part 1

1. My developer journey is still fairly new. My first interaction with any kind of code was here at Towson University. I choose Computer Science as my major because firstly, it is growing business and also because i have always enjoyed using computers and learning what i can do with computers. I decided to take this class because web development is one of the branches of computer science that i wnat to pursue when i get out of the university. Also because last semester in my software engineering course we got the cance to dabble with wed programming and it was somthing that i found interesting and wanted to leatn more of.

2. My ideal career progression is after getting my bachelors, to go on to a Masters and Doctorate program in Computer Science. Work for a startup company were ideas are continuosly flowing. Create my own mobile and web apps and even my own company. Then use all that i have learned to better the living conditions of my country of Cameroon.

3. I have some level and understanding of Java and C++, but i could use more practice with them. And i recently dabbled with HTML and CSS to creat an online form. This was mainly me watching Youtube videos and copying what the youtubers did.
